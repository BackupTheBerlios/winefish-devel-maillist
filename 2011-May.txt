Hi there,

I'm trying to forward this to the ML and get the original developer in the loop.

>From my part there is no stop-holder into do it, but as I said I'm not
the original developer. Actually I helped somehow a bit, but Anh wrote
all the code and was the main driver of it.

I think if you have the man-power and time to integrate the original
winefish code in the new bluefish release (or port the specific LaTeX
code) this would be amazing.

I've proxied this request to the original developer (the only mail
I've got I guess) and to the Winefish-ML, just to try to see if there
is any interest.

Best,
Michele

I am very glad when receiving your email. I am at the office; I will reply with more details tonight (Vietnamese time.)

Best regards,

Awesome,

just want to add in the loop Vojta, which designed this splash for
winefish and offered it a bunch of weeks ago.

Is attached.

Best,
Michele.

Hi,

I told you all that I would reply last night (ICT time), but it's so hard for me to write about a project which was started many years ago. I must think so much today; and I am sorry for the belated response.

Excellent. I love this very sexy splash :) Thank you so much, Vojta.

Yes Winefish isn't actively developed anymore :( I am being a bit busy, but the real reasons are

* I lack passion. Since I finished my thesis in 2006 I have almost been doing nothing with TeX.
 
* I had some difficulties when developing Winefish. In my last tries with Winefish development, I had at least three problems:

  (1) Low performance when enabling TeX highlighting support (as far as I remember, Winefish turns off syntax highlighting by default.) The syntax of TeX is really complex, which led me to develop some strange patterns to get highlight support in Bluefish/Winefish. The side effect was a low performance of the editor. Though Winefish is still fast for many common tasks I was still annoyed and I thought that the problem couldn't be solved.

  (2) Key binding support: I tried to implement Emacs-style key binding for Winefish, and I get some nice results. The feature appears only in the branch 'master' (http://github.com/winefish/) (aka 'trunk' when using SVN), and a full support for it requires so many works (converting all Winefish features to simple methods.)

  (3) Code folding: Around the year 2006 many TeX editors were supporting code folding, but Winefish didn't :( And as I can see in the version "2.0.3" of Bluefish, code folding isn't supported as a default feature (or I miss something to configure it.) I considered "code folding" as *must* feature, I even thought of *manually code folding*, but I found it's so hard to implement. So I simply gave up :D

First, I'd like to thank you very much for the suggestion. This is not the first time. In the very first stages of Winefish, I also had some suggestions from Bluefish Team, and I always appreciate you and Bluefish Team.

Second, let me talk about the primary purpose of Winefish: I intended to write a dedicated editor for TeX users, which be simple, powerful, clean and smart. Unfortunately, I almost fail; nowadays there are so many TeX editors with very attractive features (for example, TeXmaker and its friend xTeXmaker.) As I said, I then haven't much passion with Winefish.

So what is my final opinion? I think an integration TeX + Bluefish is very nice. Such integration would help Bluefish daily users. (I would have agreed to integrate TeX feature into Bluefish.) I will give you all some helps (syntax highlight support, symbols, tools, toolbar support,...). After receiving your feedback I may start to look at Bluefish source code and make some changes. And I hope Michele also help.

About the future version of Winefish, I have nothing to tell you now :( It's good if someone can take it over, but I strongly believe that Winefish almost reaches its end. Winefish needs to change its roadmap and/or its technical background. Or it should simply dead.

Thank you again for all.

Best regards,
