<PRE>Hi,

I told you all that I would reply last night (ICT time), but it's so hard for me to write about a project which was started many years ago. I must think so much today; and I am sorry for the belated response.

Excellent. I love this very sexy splash :) Thank you so much, Vojta.

Yes Winefish isn't actively developed anymore :( I am being a bit busy, but the real reasons are

* I lack passion. Since I finished my thesis in 2006 I have almost been doing nothing with TeX.
 
* I had some difficulties when developing Winefish. In my last tries with Winefish development, I had at least three problems:

  (1) Low performance when enabling TeX highlighting support (as far as I remember, Winefish turns off syntax highlighting by default.) The syntax of TeX is really complex, which led me to develop some strange patterns to get highlight support in Bluefish/Winefish. The side effect was a low performance of the editor. Though Winefish is still fast for many common tasks I was still annoyed and I thought that the problem couldn't be solved.

  (2) Key binding support: I tried to implement Emacs-style key binding for Winefish, and I get some nice results. The feature appears only in the branch 'master' (<A HREF="http://github.com/winefish/">http://github.com/winefish/</A>) (aka 'trunk' when using SVN), and a full support for it requires so many works (converting all Winefish features to simple methods.)

  (3) Code folding: Around the year 2006 many TeX editors were supporting code folding, but Winefish didn't :( And as I can see in the version &quot;2.0.3&quot; of Bluefish, code folding isn't supported as a default feature (or I miss something to configure it.) I considered &quot;code folding&quot; as *must* feature, I even thought of *manually code folding*, but I found it's so hard to implement. So I simply gave up :D

&gt;<i> As you seem to be the only remaining developer, what do you think of
</I>&gt;<i> integrating Winefish into Bluefish? Bluefish with TeX - that
</I>&gt;<i> would be it. That way, Winefish could benefit by any changes
</I>&gt;<i> that Bluefish gets plus there was an integrated TeX editor.
</I>&gt;<i> You may also attract more developers to contribute to the
</I>&gt;<i> project than for a five year dead project.
</I>
First, I'd like to thank you very much for the suggestion. This is not the first time. In the very first stages of Winefish, I also had some suggestions from Bluefish Team, and I always appreciate you and Bluefish Team.

Second, let me talk about the primary purpose of Winefish: I intended to write a dedicated editor for TeX users, which be simple, powerful, clean and smart. Unfortunately, I almost fail; nowadays there are so many TeX editors with very attractive features (for example, TeXmaker and its friend xTeXmaker.) As I said, I then haven't much passion with Winefish.

So what is my final opinion? I think an integration TeX + Bluefish is very nice. Such integration would help Bluefish daily users. (I would have agreed to integrate TeX feature into Bluefish.) I will give you all some helps (syntax highlight support, symbols, tools, toolbar support,...). After receiving your feedback I may start to look at Bluefish source code and make some changes. And I hope Michele also help.

About the future version of Winefish, I have nothing to tell you now :( It's good if someone can take it over, but I strongly believe that Winefish almost reaches its end. Winefish needs to change its roadmap and/or its technical background. Or it should simply dead.

Thank you again for all.

Best regards,
