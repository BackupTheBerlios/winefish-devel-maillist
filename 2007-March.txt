Subject: [Winefish-devel] The state of winefish and spellchecking
Message-ID: <1175109092.5982.20.camel@localhost>

Hi winefish developer,

So after an exchange of e-mail with kyanh I'm writing here to the whole
list :P

First of all the spellchecker:

The spellchecking right now is not really good.
Instead of reinvent the wheel we can try to use aspell and start it in
the "tex" mode.

Searching around it seems possible to start aspell in TeX mode with this
call:

aspell_config_replace(spell_config, "mode", "tex");

reference:
http://aspell.net/man-html/Through-the-C-API.html#Through-the-C-API
http://aspell.net/man-html/The-Options.html#The-Options

The important part is at 4.2.4

I've tried to patch the current code but I was really unsuccessful .

I think we can drop also the support to the html stuff and normal stuff.
winefish is really tuned for TeX stuff :P

2) the code.

I've tried to compile it from the svn but without any lucky. Why don't
try to have a working code into the svn and try to go on with the
development?

I'm learning C and glib stuff, so, at same point, I hope to be useful
and contribute.

Cheers,
Michele.

I have a local svn repos for winefish at my home. Howto replace the 
existing one (hosted by berlios.de) by my own one?

IMO `svn merge' or `svn dump' are, what you are looking for.

Regards, Daniel

Hi all,

I am so sorry that I left winefish lonely for months. Now the winefish's 
svn repository is now ready and I am back to develop it. You may check 
out the repos. anonymously
   $svn checkout svn://svn.berlios.de/winefish/trunk
or (if you a developer)
   $svn checkout \
     svn+ssh://developername at svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/winefish/trunk

The current version is 1.4.0.1. I tried to implement some functions and 
a better way to handle key shortcuts. Please read and copy 
<trunk>/doc/keymap to your ~/.winefish/ !
