Subject: [Winefish-devel] Porting winefish to bluefish 2.0
Message-ID: <AANLkTimxLVxgXNxkX2d9KVhGniV_JB2MeiGE1vmuSnZ8@mail.gmail.com>

Hi list,

I've just discovered that bluefish editor has been released in the version 2.0
http://bluefish.openoffice.nl/

I think the most interesting fact, from a winefish point of view, is
the support of libenchant[1] with a better spell checking ability

Is there any plan to port winefish to bluefish 2.0?

Michele.
