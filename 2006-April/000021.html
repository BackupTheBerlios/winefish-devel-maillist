<PRE>Hello Kyanh,

I need a few information about the manpage and I found also a few
issues. First the information I need for making the Debian package: I'm
currently preparing an official Debian package. Therefor I must follow
stricter rules when I write down the copyright information for the
package. So I need to know, which copyright and license the manpage is?
Is it copyrighted by Mich&#232;le Garoche? Is it licensed under the GPL?
Could you please add this information at least as head-comments in the
manpage roff source? Just add at the top:

.\&quot; Author(s): Mich&#232;le Garoche (...)
.\&quot; Copyright: Copyright (C) 2006 ...
.\&quot;   License: ... small license info ...

Then the issues I found (I've attached the patch againast 1.3.3 and the
resulting manpage):

* header information:
- Version is already 1.3.3 - two possibilities: (a) use the date (of
last change) instead of the version number there, which is more common
(there you could use an SVN keyword for the date instead), or (b)
process the file via autoconf and automatically add the real version
number and package name (a patch can be submitted if wanted)
- &quot;Winefish&quot; should be all-uppercase
- instead of &quot;kyanh&quot; you should use '$PACKAGE $VERSION' (both could be
added automatically during autoconf run)
- this is more common usage of the headers

* SYNTAX
- wrong section title - following the man-page howto the section title
is SYNOPSIS
- bold/italic usage is not correct - options, commands, ... are bold;
parameters, file-names and replaceable stuff is italic

* DESCRIPTION
- pdflatex, latex, PCRE missed manpage reference
- mpved homepage and mailing list information here (and made them
lickable) - see also the notes at AUTHORS

* OPTIONS
- same bold/italic &quot;issues&quot;
- a few improvements (which IMHO look better) are possible - see the
attached patch

* FILES
- ditto: file-names are italic elements

* EXAMPLES
- ditto - the command is bold, not the comment (only a title would be
bold)

* AUTHORS
- small typo in Mich&#232;les name
- small typo in &quot;It may be used by other distribution.&quot; (should be
plural)
- all the homepage, mailing-list and other documentation information do
not belong to the AUTHORS section - instead put the homepage and list
info into DESCRIPTION and other documentation belongs to SEE ALSO
- the location for winefish.html seems incorrect, it should be
$prefix/share/doc/winefish/winefish.html. AFAIK no packages
documentation is directly put into $prefix/share/doc
- $prefix could be replaced by: moving winefish.1 to winefish.1.in,
replace '$prefix' with '@prefix@' and then process this file during
configure run - then prefix is replaced with the real value (same can
automatically add the PACKAGE and VERSION variable)

* SEE ALSO
- should definitely be added to reference all manpages for helper tools,
basics for LaTeX and other documentation - the current list may be
incomplete - to be honest: referencing makes more sense, if the command
lines are changeable -&gt; I did _not_ test, if you hardcode the commands

Regards, Daniel
