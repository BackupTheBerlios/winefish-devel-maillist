</I>&gt;<i> Thank you very much. I cannot repeat the bug which relates to

</I>Answer in berlioz bugs.

&gt;<i> For the Template, see Menu Edit/Find, Replace/Templates.
</I>Oh, yes, sorry, forgot that. I'll add a note in Fink for accelerate  
keys to be changed.


&gt;<i> I update this in
</I>&gt;<i> documentation. For the last one (brace finder) there may be a bug.  
</I>&gt;<i> But the
</I>&gt;<i> finder was almost reimplemented. Winefish 1.3.2-RC1 will be  
</I>&gt;<i> released soon.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Then concerning the fr.po file, you should not change the copyright,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it is copyrighted the translator, then the Free Software Foundation,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> which is sufficient to ensure that the file pertains to winefish, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> could be transferred to any subsequent translator. Even less the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> language, the last translator, the language team.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am so sorry about that. I have opened it kbabel to check for  
</I>&gt;<i> fuzzy messages.
</I>&gt;<i> May kbabel change it?
</I>Yes, that's the problem; kbabel is not good for it, it is good for  
the translator to update his own po file, not for the programmer to  
update the whole translation tree;
Use gettext to do this. Then you could check if there is any fuzzy  
message or untranslated one. Update your own translation, but not the  
other ones. Send the new generated po files to the translators, they  
will translate them if needed or not, that's up to them.
For this to work the cvs or svn tree or a snapshoot corresponding to  
the pre-release should be available to all translators.
Personnally I don't need any po file, I know how to generate them and  
update them, what I need is either a working svn/cvs tree or the  
latest pre-release snapshot, because I will also be the Fink's  
maintainer of the package, then I should be able to dive into the  
code if needed.

Here's the shell script I use to update the pot file and generate new  
po files (that's for fr, but you could easily transform it for all po  
files). It is the exact mirror of what happened when you compile the  
package.

Assuming the code tree is located under $HOME and whole code is  
under, say winefish-1.3.2.6, it becomes:

#! /bin/sh -ev
cd ${HOME}/winefish-1.3.2.6/po
xgettext --from-code=UTF-8 --default-domain=winefish --keyword=_ -- 
keyword=N_ ../src/*.c
echo &quot;updating fr.po&quot;
msgmerge -v -o fr-patched.po fr.po winefish.po

Put it in  a text file, give it executable permissions and run it, it  
will generate a new pot file under po/winefish.po and update the  
French po file under fr-patched.po according to the change in the  
tree. If the message in the terminal is ok, that is no fuzzy, no  
untranslated, you can safely delete it. If not delete the old one  
(fr.po) and rename fr-patched.po to fr.po.

The below version is for all po files, but is more radical in that  
sense that it renames also the po files on the fly. I find it less  
convenient some time:

#! /bin/sh -ev
cd ${HOME}/bluefishcvs/winefish-1.3.2.6/po

echo &quot;updating pot file&quot;
xgettext --from-code=UTF-8 --default-domain=winefish --keyword=_ -- 
keyword=N_ ../src/*.c

echo &quot;updating po files&quot;
for x in `ls *.po`; do
echo &quot;===========&quot;
echo &quot;updating $x&quot;
y=`basename $x .po`
if [ $x != &quot;winefish.po&quot; ]
then
msgmerge -v -o $y-patched.po $x winefish.po
else
echo &quot;Nothing to do&quot;
fi
done

echo &quot;renaming new po files&quot;
for x in `ls *-patched.po`; do
echo &quot;===========&quot;
echo &quot;renaming $x&quot;
mv $x `echo $x | sed -e &quot;s/-patched//&quot;`
done

And generally speaking, when updating the po file, the translator  
should change the PO-Revision-Date (not forgetting to change the  
summer/winter delay if appropriate), and Project-Id-Version (it  
should be normally nameoftheproject-versionnumberoftherelease). It is  
a good way to be sure the file is uptodate and matches the release  
version.


&gt;<i> Anyway, i use the new one...
</I>By the way, you've done the same for it.po. I've taken the liberty to  
update it (changing a bit the headers to reflect the real situation)  
and changing the string for French translator (should be ok, at least  
if my Italian studies' memory is not treacherous).

Hope Daniele does not mind.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Then I wonder the utility of the svn access, since it does not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> reflect the last state of winefish. Could you work on it, so that we
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> can ensure we work on the same source code?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have to work offline. I have no  line here event in a modern  
</I>&gt;<i> city. I moved
</I>&gt;<i> the svn root to my local computer. I rarely connect to internet  
</I>&gt;<i> using my
</I>&gt;<i> desktnote. (About once a week.) So let svn access overthere die;(
</I>Oh, that is sad. Well, as long as you could put say once a week, a  
new snapshot, I think it will be workeable.

I've also corrected misspelling in doc and changed some parts related  
to the way to change autotext and words. Hope you will not drop the  
autoX panel in preferences, since it is a very good way to modify  
parts without having to relaunch winefish.

By the way, I'm unable to produce the html file from the Makefile.  
TIPS should be also reflect the changes for autotext and words parts.

Now, I will test the new version. Hopefully I can do it fully this  
morning, as I'll not be at home this afternoon (St Valentine's day by  
us :-).

Amicalement,
