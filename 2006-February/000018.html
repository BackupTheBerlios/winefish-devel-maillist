Le 15 f&#233;vr. 2006 &#224; 09:17, kyanh a &#233;crit :

&gt;&gt;<i> Oh, that is sad. Well, as long as you could put say once a week, a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> new snapshot, I think it will be workeable.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Once as week...? this is almost useless. I used `winefish-devel'  
</I>&gt;<i> instead!
</I>Well, that's the same for me. This way I can tell you immediately if  
there are some glitches on the Mac.

&gt;&gt;<i> Hope you will not drop the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> autoX panel in preferences, since it is a very good way to modify
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> parts without having to relaunch winefish.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For
</I>&gt;<i> AutoX: the 'autocopletion' page may be dropped. as winefish  
</I>&gt;<i> collects commands
</I>&gt;<i> automatically when you're editing. moreover now you can `delete'  
</I>&gt;<i> any word
</I>&gt;<i> directly from popup menu.
</I>I mean add them. That's for users as me who don't know perfectly tex.

&gt;<i> So the page is almost useless (since its life till
</I>&gt;<i> now i have never used it to add/remove any words;))
</I>Well, I understand that, but you're not alone to use your software,  
so it maybe useful to others. I do it, and I know others will do it  
too. Say you have something a bit complicated, you can copy it from  
some tex file, then use it in another one. That's just for avoiding  
to desesperately type a false tex command, then as you say, one it is  
typed it is collected. The first one does not impede the second one.


Cheers,
Mich&#232;le
