I received the  patch yesterday and I have successfull patched it.
Now  there's Winefish 1.3.2.6(g) that you may download here
<A HREF="http://download.berlios.de/winefish/winefish-1.3.2.6g.tgz">http://download.berlios.de/winefish/winefish-1.3.2.6g.tgz</A>

( with some small bugs fixed (included the one reported by M.
Garoche), and a better brace finder (select the brace if found) )

Please update the po files.
* There are some fuzzy strings in `it.po'.
* For the `fr.po': could M. Garoche fix a string in about.c? (I use
`francaise' for French, but it should be `francais' ;))

I have been back to my studies. Now i am very busy. So winefish
1.3.2.6g is the last one before 1.3.2.6. After receiving your
updated po files, i will announce 1.3.2.6 ;) That is the spring
release. Please wait for Summer releases for more features ;)

I am sorry for late reply. 

Thank you very much for translation.

Thank M. Garoche very much for the patches.

Regards,

kyanh
