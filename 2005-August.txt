Did you observe any problems related with my mail-address or is it a
local problem on your system?

Always with the same file or independent from the file but reproducible
with dvips? It would be very useful, if you could make a backtrace. I
will try to reproduce it here too. To make a backtrace, please follow

http://bfwiki.tellefsen.net/index.php?pagename=DebuggingBluefish

Instead of typing 'bt' type 'bt full'. This is more useful.
