Hi all,

last 4 months i had to study hard
so I had notime for Winefish.

I am going to a "ONE" free-month for coding
before continueing my 2nd term;(

I am going to remove HTML toolbar from Winefish:
I have never used it ;) Please comment this idea.

Below some things I will do:

* fix output box and bugs reported at:
http://developer.berlios.de/bugs/?group_id=4105
* drop HTML toolbar (above)
* remove some item from Edit Menu
(\textit,\texbf, some ams environments)
* add some function to delete words from PopUP menu
* etc.

Feel free to comment.

Thank you very much for enjoy Winefish.

Best regards,

kyanh
